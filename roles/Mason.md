description: Two town-aligned players that know each other
---

At the beginning of each game two members of the town are placed in the same special role private channel called masons'-playhouse. The masons are two town members who have no special ability except knowing that the other is town.

The masons are allowed to 'out' themselves as masons and request PRs (power roles) to claim their roles to them. If no no cc (counter claims) appear this is also most often the case. With whispers (using the shhhhhhh bot) enabled this allows a strong PR network, something that is generally considered OP (overpowered) which is why the masons are not in use anymore.

### Interactions
The <Role> does not have any special interactions.
